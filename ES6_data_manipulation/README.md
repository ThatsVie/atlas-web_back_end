# ES6 Data Manipulation

## Learning Objectives

### How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays

### Typed arrays

### The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

## Task Overview

### 0-get_list_students.js
Create a function named `getListStudents` that returns an array of student objects. Each object includes three attributes: `id` (a number), `firstName` (a string), and `location` (a string). The function must return details for students named Guillaume, James, and Serena with specific IDs and locations as described.

## File Overview

### Task 0
- `0-get_list_students.js`: This file contains the `getListStudents` function that returns an array of objects, each representing a student with `id`, `firstName`, and `location` attributes. This setup demonstrates the creation and use of basic data structures in JavaScript.

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-web_back_end.git
```

```
cd ES6_data_manipulation
```

## Setup
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. [ Visit this site for details about which version may be appropriate for you ](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

**Install Jest**

Jest is used for running tests. Install Jest using npm by running:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

**Install Babel**

Babel is used for compiling ES6+ JavaScript to backwards-compatible versions. Install Babel along with necessary presets:
```
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

**Install ESLint**

ESLint is used to ensure code quality and consistency. Install ESLint with:
```
npm install --save-dev eslint
```

## Usage

### Task 0
To run the `0-main.js` script and test the implementation of the `getListStudents` function, use the following command:
```
npm run dev 0-main.js
```

This command executes the `0-main.js` script, which imports the `getListStudents` function from `0-get_list_students.js` and logs the array of student objects to the console. The output confirms that the function correctly creates and returns a structured array of student data with their respective IDs, names, and locations.
