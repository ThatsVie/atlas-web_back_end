# Queuing System in JS
This project focuses on building a queue system using Redis, Kue, and Express in Node.js. We will cover topics such as running Redis, performing operations with Redis clients, handling async tasks, and building an Express app that interacts with Redis and a queue system.

## Learning Objectives
<details>
  <summary><strong>How to run a Redis server on your machine</strong></summary>

  Redis is essential for queuing and caching in real-time applications. We will install and run Redis as the first step in this project.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  redis-server
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to run simple operations with the Redis client</strong></summary>

  Using the Redis client in Node.js, you can perform simple operations like setting and getting key-value pairs.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to store hash values in Redis</strong></summary>

  Redis supports storing and retrieving hash values, which can represent objects or data structures.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to deal with async operations with Redis</strong></summary>

  Redis operations in Node.js are asynchronous by default. We will use callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle them effectively.
  

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to use Kue as a queue system</strong></summary>

  Kue is a priority job queue backed by Redis. We will implement job processing and management in later tasks using Kue.
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How to build a basic Express app interacting with Redis and Kue</strong></summary>

  In this project, we will create an Express app that interacts with Redis and queues tasks using Kue.
