# ES6 Classes

## Learning Objectives

## Tasks Overview
### Task 0:
The objective is to implement a class named `ClassRoom` that captures the maximum number of students a room can hold.

## File Overview
- `0-classroom.js`: Contains the implementation of the `ClassRoom` class. This class accepts a `maxStudentsSize` parameter in its constructor and assigns it to a private property `_maxStudentsSize`.
- `0-main.js`: A testing script used to validate the functionality of the `ClassRoom` class by creating an instance and logging the `_maxStudentsSize` property.

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/ThatsVie/atlas-web_back_end.git
```

```
cd ES6_classes
```

## Setup
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. [ Visit this site for details about which version may be appropriate for you ](https://github.com/nodejs/Release)

**Install Jest**

Jest is used for running tests. Install Jest using npm by running:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

**Install Babel**

Babel is used for compiling ES6+ JavaScript to backwards-compatible versions. Install Babel along with necessary presets:
```
npm install --save-dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

**Install ESLint**

ESLint is used to ensure code quality and consistency. Install ESLint with:
```
npm install --save-dev eslint
```
## Usage

### Task 0
To run the 0-main.js script and test the implementation, use the following command:
```
npm run dev 0-main.js
```
When you run the above command, it executes the script 0-main.js, which imports the ClassRoom class and creates an instance with a maxStudentsSize of 10. The script then logs the value of _maxStudentsSize:

This output confirms that the ClassRoom instance has been successfully created with a maximum student size of 10, and that the _maxStudentsSize property is correctly storing and retrieving this value.
