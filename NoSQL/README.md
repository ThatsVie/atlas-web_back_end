## Concepts

In this project, we will learn:

- What NoSQL means and how it differs from SQL.
- The benefits of NoSQL databases, especially in this era where everyone wants data to move at the speed of light (we’re not there yet, but hey, MongoDB’s fast).
- How document storage works and why NoSQL loves the chaos of unstructured data.
- How to query, insert, update, and delete data from a NoSQL database like a pro (or at least an intern).

## Learning Objectives


- What NoSQL means (hint: it's not "not SQL").
- Differences between SQL and NoSQL (the relational chaos vs. the document freedom).
- What ACID is and why NoSQL databases sometimes play it fast and loose with those rules.
- What document storage is and why you won’t need 10 different JOINs to find that one piece of data.
- Types of NoSQL databases.
- Benefits of NoSQL databases in a world that increasingly feels like it's spiraling out of control.
- How to query, insert, update, and delete data in MongoDB like a responsible adult who doesn't accidentally drop entire databases.
- How to use MongoDB effectively, even if you’re still wondering whether SQL will ever forgive you.


## Requirements

### MongoDB Command Files

- Files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MongoDB (version 4.4).
- Each file should end with a new line (yes, really).
- The first line of every file must be a comment (`// my comment`).
- A `README.md` file, like this one, is mandatory (you’ve come to the right place!).
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Scripts

- Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.9 and PyMongo 4.8.0.
- Each file should end with a new line.
- The first line must be `#!/usr/bin/env python3` (so the interpreter knows what’s up).
- Follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.5.*) like a sacred text.
- All functions and modules must be documented.
- Make sure your code doesn’t execute when imported (that’s what `if __name__ == "__main__":` is for).
