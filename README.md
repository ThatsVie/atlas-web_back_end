# Atlas - Web Back End

## ES6 Basic

This project covers ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features and best practices in modern JavaScript development. It covers topics such as variable declaration with `let` and `const`, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template literals, `spread/rest` operators, object creation, and iterators.

## ES6 Classes

This project covers ES6 classes including creating and managing different classes and subclasses, showcasing essential concepts like inheritance, method overriding, and data encapsulation. It also  covers static methods and metaprogramming with symbols to dynamically control how classes behave, especially when cloning objects.

## ES6 Data Manipulation

This project focuses on array methods, typed arrays, and complex data structures like `Set` and `Map`. The tasks cover how to manipulate data efficiently, applying methods such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and exploring how `Sets` and `Maps` can be used to handle unique data and key-value storage. This project reinfonforces JavaScript skills and highlights real-world applicability of ES6 features.

## ES6 Promises

This project covers the functionality and applications of ES6 Promises, focusing on understanding asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Various tasks implement and handle promises using methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `Promise.allSettled()`, alongside employing `async/await` syntax.
