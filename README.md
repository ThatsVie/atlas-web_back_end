## ES6 Basic

This project covers ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features and best practices in modern JavaScript development. It covers topics such as variable declaration with `let` and `const`, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, template literals, `spread/rest` operators, object creation, and iterators.

## ES6 Classes

This project covers ES6 classes including creating and managing different classes and subclasses, showcasing essential concepts like inheritance, method overriding, and data encapsulation. It also  covers static methods and metaprogramming with symbols to dynamically control how classes behave, especially when cloning objects.

## ES6 Data Manipulation

This project focuses on array methods, typed arrays, and complex data structures like `Set` and `Map`. The tasks cover how to manipulate data efficiently, applying methods such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and exploring how `Sets` and `Maps` can be used to handle unique data and key-value storage.

## ES6 Promises

This project covers the functionality and applications of ES6 Promises, focusing on understanding asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Various tasks implement and handle promises using methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `Promise.allSettled()`, alongside employing `async/await` syntax.

## Python - Variable Annotations

This project focuses on understanding and applying variable annotations in Python. Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning variable types are set at runtime upon assignment. In Python 3, type annotations allow developers to specify expected types for variables, parameters, and return values, enhancing code readability and validation.

## Python - Async Function

This project covers asynchronous programming in Python using coroutines and the async/await syntax to handle concurrent tasks. It demonstrates managing multiple asynchronous operations, measuring performance, and creating tasks with the asyncio library. It covers concepts like running coroutines concurrently, measuring execution time, and managing tasks which is ideal for optimizing I/O-bound operations such as web requests or database queries.

## Python - Async Comprehension

This project focuses on using Python's asynchronous capabilities to handle tasks concurrently and efficiently. It demonstrates the creation of asynchronous generators, the use of async comprehensions to gather data, and the measurement of runtime for parallel tasks using asyncio.

## Caching

This project covers different caching algorithms, including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU, to optimize data retrieval performance by managing temporary storage of frequently accessed data. It demonstrates various cache replacement strategies to efficiently handle limited cache size and improve system responsiveness. By implementing these algorithms, the project highlights the trade-offs and effectiveness of each caching method in different scenarios.
